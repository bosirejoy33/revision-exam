Title: ui and store for FocusTasks

Decision:
- Use a closure-based store (createStore) that  persists to localStorage key "focustasks_0163".
- Use  functions for analytics (summarize) and for list transforms.
- Use event delegation: one click listener for both lists and one submit listener for add.
- Escape user-provided titles client-side before DOM insertion.

Rationale:
- Closure prevents accidental global mutation and simplifies unit-testing of store API.
- Delegation reduces memory overhead and matches requirement of single listener per area.
- Client-side escaping prevents XSS in this single-user app; note server-side escaping and CSP needed in multi-user apps.

Status: implemented
